`./scripts/data` Directory
=========

This directory contains scripts that transform the raw data obtained from a longitudinal study into a dataset ready for statistical analysis.  

The order of their execution is described in [./.flow-description.md]() and implemented in [./utility/reproduce.R]() script, which must be executed to reproduce the analysis-ready dataset.
