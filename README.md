IALSA-Data-Curator project
===

To facilitate replication across studies, the IALSA research network launched "Data Curator" project, which organizes preparations of data sets from selected longitudinal studies for analysis. 

Each longitudinal study is represented with two repositories: public and private. A private repository is visible only to the specific team created with affiliates of the IALSA network with verified github accounts.  A public version of a private repository for the same study removes sensitive data and present the currently available reports.
