IALSA-Data-Curator project
===

To facilitate replication across studies, the IALSA research network launched "**Data Curator**" project, which organizes the preparation of data sets for analysis from selected longitudinal studies of the network. 

**ARCHITECHTURE** Each longitudinal study is represented with two repositories: public and private. A private repository is visible only to the specific team created with affiliates of the IALSA network who have verified github accounts. A public version of a private repository for the corresponding study removes sensitive data and organizes the currently available reports for the presentation to the general public of researchers. 

**ACCESS LEVELS** Permissions to private repositories are handled through [IALSA teams](https://github.com/orgs/IALSA/teams). The name of the team (e.g. "MAP-read", "MAP-write", "LASA-read") reflects both the study name and the access level. Teams with "read" in their names have read-only access, while "write" teams can push content to the repository.
